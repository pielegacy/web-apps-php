                <h2>Enhancements</h2>
                <ol class="enhancement-list">
                    <li><em>Adaptive CSS</em><br/>The CSS of my site is responsive and will reform depending on screensize so that elements
                    use the screenspace as effectively as possible.</li>
                    <li><em>Usage of the Flexbox element</em><br/>
                    Whilst not being taught during the tutorials, I decided to use the flexbox element which is a new type of tag introduced
                    to make content render fluidly depending on a set of rules and the size of the container
                    it is being contained in. This is seen on the <a href="index.html" class="siglink">index</a> and <a href="jobs.html" class="siglink">jobs</a> page, the divs being evenly split amongst the space
                    they are given whilst also rearranging to suit any screen size.</li>
                    <li><em>Real World Design</em><br/>
                    In an effort to emulate a realistic feeling for the task, I have decided to implement a design which inherit from
                    the design language of other business sites. Using blue, a colour often related to success and business, as the sites
                    accent is one example but ultimately I tried to make a site that was visually appealing and also very effective
                    in delivering the content it presents. I also decided to hide features which are required for the project but wouldn't
                    be so overbearing in a real world design. An example of this being the enhancements page not being included in the main
                    navigation as in a real world scenario site visitors would not care about the site's enhancements in comparison to
                    the job descriptions and application page.</li>
                    <li><em><a href="apply.php" class="siglink">Additional Elements For The Application Page</a></em><br/>
                    Including languages such as SQL and database technologies like MongoDb as requirements in the job descriptions
                    is an addition I decided to include so that the feel of the website was more real and less generic. Including the
                    option to upload a resume/cv in the application page was also an enhancement, giving users more ways to leave
                    a good impression to potential employers.

                    <li><em></em><br/></li>-->
